Creating the floor plan
Start by creating a floor plan over your house or apartment as an SVG File.  
There are numerous instructions on different ways to do that. 
In the end the floor plan needs to be an svg file. Note however that you may possibly 
embedd bitmaps such as jpg or pngs into the svg file but it is perhaps not the best idea.

Perhaps the easiest way is to base your floor plan on the one found in the examples folder.

Add symbols for how you want your sensors and actuators to be visualized. 
It is important that the symbols are named correctly

When you are happy with your floor plan and symbols it is time to set up the rules.
Again the simplest approach is to have a look in the example rules files. 



No we are set to generate the contents. make sure that the floor plan is saved. 

Open a command line terminal in the project folder and run node floorplangen.js 
and provide the required inforamation 

When running the script found enteties are listed which can be helpful information. 

Note that you can run the script on a file where the entities have been positioned if 
for instance a new sensor is added or moved
